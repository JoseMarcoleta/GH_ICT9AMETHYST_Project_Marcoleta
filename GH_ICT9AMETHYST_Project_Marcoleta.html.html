      <td><h5>Keep Oils And Gases Away From Flames And Sparks</h5>
      If you keep cooking oil in your kitchen you want to keep it away from the stove or anything that could potentially spark and cause a fire. The same goes for gas that you might keep in a garage for your car, your lawnmower or anything else. You want to keep the gas away from a potential spark or flame. By carefully containing these things in approved containers and keeping them a safe distance away from anything that could react with them you’re going to be better prepared and cut your risk of problems at the same time.</td>

      <td><h5>Never Leave Flames Unattended</h5>If you’re cooking, lighting candles, or using any other type of flame or excessive heat, you want to make sure that you’re watching it at all times. If you start cooking anything, you never want to walk away from the stove. If you start a fire in your fireplace you want to make sure you keep an eye on that as well.By keeping an eye on these types of flames you can recognize quickly if there’s a problem or if they aren’t the way they are supposed to be. That means you’d be able to take care of the problem quickly and make sure you and your family are safe. This is also a good place to have a fire extinguisher and smoke alarms.</td>

      <td><h5> Keep a fire extinguisher or blanket around at all times!</h5>Fire extinguishers and blankets will be your best defence in the event of a fire breaking out. Every family member should know how to use a fire extinguisher, so in case something in your home does catch fire, it can be put out as fast as possible. Fire blankets are also very useful for putting out small fires before they become something larger and fiercer. There is nothing more devastating than losing all your belongings to a house fire. After all, your home is likely to be the source of many beautiful memories, and you owe it to yourself to protect it. </td>

      <td><h5>Maintain your wires</h5>Before you plug something into a socket, try to be courteous in ensuring that the wire hasn’t been torn or chewed up (in case you have any pets running around). Damaged wires can be a detrimental fire hazard and need replacing as soon as possible. Also, remember that wires do get hot when in use, so be sure to check your wire placement and avoiding passing them under a carpet or anywhere that could potentially catch fire.</td>
